# TODO List for the Software/Game Testing Application

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Implement a MySQL database to store employee information and bug reports.
- [x] Update the `EmployeeModel` class to interact with the MySQL database for saving and retrieving data.
- [x] Modify the `EmployeeController` class to call the appropriate methods from the `EmployeeModel` to save data to the database.

### File: 'model.py'

#### Database Integration
- [x] Establish a secure and efficient connection to a database for saving sessions and reports.

### File: 'controller.py'

#### Controller Logic
- [x] Create methods for saving data to the database on button clicks.
- [ ] Implement input validation and sanitization to protect against SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.

### File: 'main.py'

#### Application Initialization
- [ ] Incorporate a startup check for database availability and integrity.

## Enhancements

- [ ] Integrate real-time spell checking and autocorrection functionality.
- [ ] Implement a more dynamic and interactive date and time picker.
- [ ] Design and implement a feedback mechanism for user actions (e.g., saving data).

## General Research

### Software Engineering Principles Application
- [ ] Incorporate comprehensive error logging and handling mechanisms.
- [ ] Explore advanced MVC frameworks or libraries to streamline development.
- [ ] Conduct research on modern, user-friendly design patterns for enterprise applications.

## Additional Tasks

### User Authentication and Authorization
- [ ] Implement user registration and login functionality to secure access to the app.
- [ ] Define user roles and permissions to control access to different features based on user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).

### Data Validation and Error Handling
- [ ] Implement data validation on user inputs to ensure data integrity and prevent invalid or malicious input.
- [ ] Display appropriate error messages to the user when validation fails or when exceptions occur.
- [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging to track and fix issues during development and production.

### Enhanced User Interface
- [ ] Improve the visual appearance of the app by using a modern and responsive UI framework like Bootstrap or Material Design.
- [ ] Implement form validation and provide real-time feedback to the user.

### Search and Filtering
- [ ] Add search functionality to allow users to search for specific employees, bug reports, or other data.
- [ ] Implement filtering options to enable users to filter data based on various criteria (e.g., date range, shift, location).

### Data Export and Reporting
- [ ] Provide options to export data (e.g., employee information, bug reports) in various formats like CSV, Excel, or PDF.
- [ ] Generate reports and summaries based on the collected data, such as employee performance metrics or bug report statistics.

### Notifications and Alerts
- [ ] Implement a notification system to alert users about important events or actions (e.g., new bug reports, pending tasks).
- [ ] Use email or push notifications to keep users informed even when they are not actively using the app.

### Testing and Continuous Integration
- [ ] Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of critical components and functions in your app.
- [ ] Implement integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules and components.
- [ ] Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to automatically run tests and deploy the app when changes are made.

### Documentation and Help
- [ ] Provide comprehensive documentation for your app, including installation instructions, user guides, and API references.
- [ ] Include context-sensitive help within the app to assist users in understanding and using different features.

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Analyze the performance of your app and identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
- [ ] Optimize database queries, minimize network requests, and implement caching mechanisms to enhance performance.
- [ ] Consider using asynchronous programming techniques (e.g., asyncio) for time-consuming tasks to avoid blocking the main thread.

### Bug Report Attachments
- [ ] Allow users to attach files, screenshots, or videos to bug reports to provide additional context and clarity.

### Bug Report Status Tracking
- [ ] Implement a system to track the status of bug reports (e.g., open, in progress, resolved).
- [ ] Allow users to update the status of bug reports as they are being worked on.

### Collaborative Bug Reporting
- [ ] Enable multiple users to collaborate on a single bug report.
- [ ] Allow users to add comments, assign tasks, and track progress on bug reports.

### Bug Report Prioritization
- [ ] Implement a priority system for bug reports to help prioritize and manage the workload effectively.

### Bug Report Search and Filtering
- [ ] Provide advanced search and filtering options specifically for bug reports.
- [ ] Allow users to search bug reports based on keywords, severity, status, or other relevant criteria.

### User Profiles and Preferences
- [ ] Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including contact information, notification preferences, and personalized settings.

### Shift Scheduling and Management
- [ ] Implement a shift scheduling feature that allows managers to assign shifts to employees and track shift coverage.

### Employee Performance Metrics
- [ ] Introduce employee performance metrics and analytics to track productivity, bug resolution rate, and other relevant metrics.

### Integration with Issue Tracking Systems
- [ ] Integrate the app with popular issue tracking systems like JIRA or Bugzilla to seamlessly sync bug reports and track their status across platforms.
